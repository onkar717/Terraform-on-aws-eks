# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Basics

## Overview

This guide explores the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and explains how Terraform helps address challenges commonly encountered with traditional infrastructure management methods.

## Step 01: Understand Problems with Traditional Way of Managing Infrastructure

1. **Time it Takes for Building Multiple Environments**
   - Building and configuring multiple environments (e.g., development, testing, production) manually can be time-consuming, leading to delayed deployments and a slower development cycle.

2. **Issues with Different Environments**
   - Manually configured environments often lead to inconsistencies and configuration drift, which can cause unexpected issues or bugs when applications behave differently across environments.

3. **Scale-Up and Scale-Down On-Demand**
   - Scaling resources up or down as demand changes is challenging without automation, often resulting in inefficient resource usage or downtime during peak loads.

## Step 02: How IaC with Terraform Solves These Issues

1. **Visibility**
   - Terraformâ€™s configuration files provide a clear, declarative view of your infrastructure, making it easy to understand and review changes before they are applied.

2. **Stability**
   - By defining infrastructure as code, Terraform ensures consistent configurations across all environments, reducing configuration drift and providing predictable outcomes.

3. **Scalability**
   - Terraform enables seamless scaling by automating the provisioning and de-provisioning of resources, allowing infrastructure to adapt quickly to demand changes.

4. **Security**
   - Infrastructure as Code embeds security practices within the configuration, enforcing compliance and reducing risk through code-based security controls.

5. **Audit**
   - Terraform's configuration files act as a record of infrastructure changes, allowing you to track who made changes, when they were made, and what was altered, supporting audit and compliance requirements.

## Conclusion

Using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) addresses key limitations of traditional infrastructure management, providing a reliable, scalable, and secure approach to managing modern infrastructure.
